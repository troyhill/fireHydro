\title{Downloads quarterly EDEN data (from 1991 through present)}
\usage{
getQuarterlyEDEN(
  YYYYMMDD,
  DEM = raster(system.file("extdata/edenDEM.grd", package = "fireHydro")),
  quarterly = FALSE,
  download.method = "libcurl"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{YYYYMMDD}{EDEN date to be used for water levels. Should be an 8-digit numeric or character stirng, e.g., "20181018". By default, today's date is used; if "exact = FALSE" this returns the most recent EDEN data available.}

\item{DEM}{raster digital elevation model for south Florida. Used to subtract land elevations from water surface to get water depths. The default DEM is a USGS/EDEN product in meters NAVD88. If `DEM = NULL`, output will be water surface in centimeters NAVD88.}

\item{quarterly}{logical; if set to TRUE, entire quarter is downloaded.}

\item{download.method}{Method to be used for downloading files. See options in utils::download.file}
}
\value{
eden \code{getQuarterlyEDEN} returns an `eden` object, which is a list with two elements: (1) a vector of dates in the specified quarter, and (2) a rasterStack with a water depth layer for each date (units = cm w.r.t. soil surface, unless `DEM = NULL`).
}
\description{
Provides access to quarterly data covering the entire period of record. Downloads netCDF files from https://sflthredds.er.usgs.gov/thredds/catalog/eden/surfaces/catalog.html. This function makes `fireHydro` able to operate with complete independence from Department of Interior servers. This code generates a water depth map using the USGS water surface data and the USGS EDEN digital elevation map (present in this R package as raster layer "edenDEM"). NOTE: on 20220131, download.file was changed to use method = 'curl' (resolving broken code). This requires that curl be installed and available in users' PATH variable, which may not be the case for all users.
